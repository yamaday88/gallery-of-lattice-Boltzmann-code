## Introduction

The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a powerful computational fluid dynamics technique. It models fluid flow using a lattice grid and is particularly effective for simulating complex boundary conditions and multiphase flows. This repository aims to provide various implementations of LBM that are optimized for different applications.

## Features

- **Scalability**: Designed to run efficiently on both single and multi-GPU systems.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various grid types, including Cartesian grids.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new models or modify existing ones.
- **Integration**: Compatible with machine learning frameworks for enhanced simulations.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes implementations and examples related to the following topics:

- **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**: Improve resolution in areas of interest.
- **Cartesian Grid**: Simple and efficient grid structure for simulations.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverage the power of GPUs for faster computations.
- **Input/Output (I/O)**: Efficient data handling for large simulations.
- **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**: Core algorithm for fluid dynamics.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate ML techniques for predictive modeling.
- **Massive Data Handling**: Manage large datasets generated from simulations.
- **Message Passing Interface (MPI)**: Parallel processing for distributed systems.
- **Multiphase Flows**: Simulate interactions between different fluid phases.
- **Phase Change**: Model phenomena like boiling and condensation.
- **Porous Media**: Study fluid flow through porous structures.
